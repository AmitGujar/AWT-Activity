	<description>You really can't go wrong with any of Jasmine Guillory's fun, romantic romps, but this Reese's Book Club pick is especially great. Freelance writer Nik's boyfriend proposes at a Dodger's game, and the dude can't even spell her name right. She says no (duh), and the video goes viral. Handsome doctor Carlos sweeps her away from the frenzy, but he can't possibly be the real deal. Or can he? </description>

	<description>This book free if you have a Kindle! And you should definitely take advantage of that â€“ it's basically the O.G. romance novel. If you're already a Jane Austen stan, check out Curtis Sittenfeld's reinterpretation Eligible, which sets Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy in modern-day Cincinnati. </description>
