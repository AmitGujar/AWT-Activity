	<description>You really can't go wrong with any of Jasmine Guillory's fun, romantic romps, but this Reese's Book Club pick is especially great. Freelance writer Nik's boyfriend proposes at a Dodger's game, and the dude can't even spell her name right. She says no (duh), and the video goes viral. Handsome doctor Carlos sweeps her away from the frenzy, but he can't possibly be the real deal. Or can he? </description>

	<description>This book free if you have a Kindle! And you should definitely take advantage of that â€“ it's basically the O.G. romance novel. If you're already a Jane Austen stan, check out Curtis Sittenfeld's reinterpretation Eligible, which sets Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy in modern-day Cincinnati. </description>

	<description>This sweeping multigenerational tale of life on a sheep station in the Outback often gets described as "an Australian Gone With the Wind," so if you love that classic, try this one on for size. The romance primarily focuses on an illicit affair between Maggie, a resident on the remote ranch, and a handsome priest.</description>
